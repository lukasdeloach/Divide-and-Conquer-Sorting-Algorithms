Conclusions:
Merge sort is on average much better!
QuickSort may outperform Mergesort when there is a smaller input size say under 500000, but with the chance to go O(n^2) it really does not outperform. Overall, if I were to pick between these two, I would always pick merge sort because of its consistency with small or large input, always performing at O(nlogn).
